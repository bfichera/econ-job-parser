To learn more about the Institute: https://anderseninstitute.org/about-andersen-institute/

Research economists will join a team of micro and macro economists exploring the interconnections between major global themes such as technological innovation and artificial intelligence (AI), geopolitics and fragmentation, rising levels of public debt and demographics, and climate change and decarbonization in a poly-crisis world with significant uncertainties.

These trends will be assessed from both a micro and macro perspective, evaluating how global public and private financial markets price risks and opportunities and how businesses, governments, and financial institutions navigate these evolving trends. Key topics of interest include: 
- perspectives on how AI & other technological innovations are reshaping businesses and the labor market
- implications for businesses of the ongoing shift toward a more fragmented world and other risks for firms associated with geopolitical risk and uncertainty 
- understandings on how secular changes in demographic and climate resilience will reshape the business world over the coming decade

Recruited research economists will conduct independent and collaborative research and publish findings in top peer-reviewed journals, working paper series of the Institute, as well as in other outlets targeting business and policy audiences. They will be expected to present at research conferences, participate in public and private events, engage in dialogue with the private sector and policymakers, and contribute to the Institute’s social media presence and other dissemination channels.

Researchers work in teams that leverage skill complementarities and are encouraged to take initiative in shaping projects, and to pursue new ideas grounded on solid research methodologies.

Columbia World Projects is part of Columbia Global, which brings together major global initiatives from across the university to advance knowledge and foster global engagement. In addition to World Projects, those initiatives include the Columbia Global Centers, the Committee on Global Thought, and the Institute for Ideas and Imagination.  

Columbia Global’s mission is to address complex global challenges through groundbreaking scholarly pursuits, leadership development, cutting-edge research, and projects that aim for social impact. 

About the Columbia Center for Political Economy 

Launched in 2022, the Center for Political Economy at Columbia World Projects identifies and advances the most promising contemporary developments that concern the economy and promotes a new political economy with robust intellectual and policy incubators across distinct themes.

Position Summary 

The Columbia Center for Political Economy is seeking full-time Postdoctoral Research Scholars beginning August 1, 2026. Under the direction of the Center’s faculty Co-directors and Idea Lab leads, the Scholar will have the opportunity to pursue their own research while supporting the work of the Center. 

The Center welcomes applications that align with its broad thematic priorities, including the focus areas of the following Idea Labs – Work and Labor, Firms and Industrial Policy, Political Economy of Climate, and International Political Economy. We encourage you to select the Idea Lab that best reflects your background, expertise, and research interests. Please see below for descriptions of each Lab. 

●	Work and Labor examines the forces that influence labor and labor markets, focusing on modes of collective worker action, the interplay between government policies and worker power, how worker organizations intersect with the political process and government, and the future of domestic and international labor movements, with an emphasis on empirical research. This cycle the Work and Labor Idea Lab is especially interested in applicants whose work speaks to politics and policy, including, but not limited to, the politics of enacting labor reform at different levels of government; worker perspectives on representation through labor organizations and collective action; the design of labor policies and the effects of those policies on opportunities for building worker power and fostering collective action; coalition management between worker organizations and other movements and organized interests; and the relationship between worker organizations, including unions, and politics and government. 

●	Firms and Industrial Policy aims to gain new insights into how firms behave, to provide a grounding for policy interventions to promote innovation and shared prosperity. Industrial policy – government interventions to stimulate innovation, accelerate technological change, and promote selected industries – is back on mainstream policy agendas across the globe . But even as the policy pendulum swings back toward government intervention, the knowledge base to guide industrial policy remains underdeveloped. Topics may focus on factors that shape firms' decisions technology adoption, product innovation, quality upgrading, R&D investments, patenting, and other forms of innovative behavior; on how such decisions are influenced by market conditions, network relationships, and supply chain architectures; on novel ways to measure such decisions and influences; and on what works and doesn't work in industrial policy.

●	Political Economy of Climate explores how political and economic forces shape policy and societal responses to climate change. The Lab is most interested in fostering synergies around the following thematic areas: climate fairness and environmental justice, international collaboration or lack thereof, interests shaping the effectiveness of energy transition, and political constraints on environmental (especially climate) policies.

●	International Political Economy analyzes the intersection of international economics and international politics, including the politics of international money, finance, trade, and migration, and the interaction of international economics and geopolitics.
										
Funding for the Postdoctoral Research Scholar will cover salary for up to one year with the possibility of a one-year extension. Together with the other members of their Idea Lab, the scholar will organize seminars and conferences, public events, and additional programmatic support and outreach within the given Lab with which they are involved. 

Qualifications

Applicants must have a PhD, JSD, or equivalent from across the social sciences, history, and law.

",Quantitative Economist,"The Joint Committee on Taxation (“JCT”) invites economists to submit applications to join its staff of Quantitative Economists.

As a nonpartisan, joint committee of the United States Congress, JCT operates with an experienced professional staff of economists, attorneys, and accountants, who assist Members of the majority and minority parties with tax legislation in both the House of Representatives and Senate. The JCT staff is closely involved with every aspect of the tax legislative process, including assisting Congressional tax-writing committees and Members of Congress with development and analysis of legislative proposals, preparing official revenue estimates of all tax legislation considered by the Congress, drafting background reports for tax-related bills, and investigating various aspects of the Federal tax system. For more information on JCT’s work, see www.jct.gov.

Quantitative Economists at JCT include microeconomists, who develop economic models and apply econometric methods to analyze policy proposals at all stages of Congressional consideration, and macroeconomists, who use large quantitative general equilibrium models to analyze major tax legislation. Both roles work in a collegial environment on informal teams with other economists, tax attorneys, and accountants to contribute to the legislative process through data acquisition and analysis, model development and improvement, original research, and technical and nontechnical communication. Quantitative Economists’ work is routinely reflected in tax policies being considered by Congress.

JCT currently seeks applied microeconomists. Candidates must be prepared to conduct research, develop expertise in specific tax issues, and bring appropriate econometric techniques to large and small datasets to analyze and report the economic and administrative implications of proposed changes in Federal tax laws. Strong quantitative skills and an interest in policy design and implementation are valuable. Successful candidates will demonstrate an eagerness to impartially inform policymaking and an ability to meet deadlines in a consequential setting.

These are engaging and rewarding positions for economists interested in Federal policy and policy analysis. The breadth of current and potential Federal tax policy requires Quantitative Economists to work in diverse issue areas, from health, employment, and retirement, to business investment, energy, and the environment. Independent research spurred by economists’ Congressional work regularly appears in top academic publications.

Candidates must meet citizenship requirements for Federal employment (generally, have U.S. citizenship or have legal residency that permits timely acquisition of citizenship) and have a Ph.D. or equivalent, with training in public finance preferred. Salary is competitive, commensurate with experience, and complemented with excellent workplace benefits.

About Professor Gregory Chow
(Prepared by Professor Ben Bernanke, Chair of the Department of Economics, Princeton University, in May 2001.)

Gregory C. Chow is the Class of 1913 Professor of Political Economy Emeritus at Princeton University. He has been a major figure in econometrics and applied economics. Every beginning econometrics student learns the ""Chow test"", a statistical test for structural change in a regression. However, Gregory's work extends far beyond his eponymous test. He was a major figure in the postwar flowering of econometrics, and his applied work included important research in microeconomics, macroeconomics, and development economics (particularly in reference to Southeast Asia).

Gregory has become a towering figure in economic transition and economics education in Asia. He played an important role in the transformation of the economy of mainland China. Gregory also did a great deal for ties between China and the United States, including supporting education programs for Chinese students in both countries. His experiences and writings on China were the basis for a popular undergraduate course on the Chinese economy that Gregory taught regularly at Princeton for many years.

About Chow Institute
Paula and Gregory Chow Institute for Studies in Economics is one of China’s leading centers for research, policy evaluation and academic training. First founded as Chow Center in 2016 under the auspice and generosity of Professor Gregory Chow, Chow Institute was upgraded to an independent institution in May 2022. Our founding Director is Professor Yongmiao Hong, who is the Ernest S. Liu Professor of Economics and International Studies Emeritus at Cornell University. Chow Institute is devoted to excellence in training academic candidates, producing original research, and facilitating dialogue of strong policy relevance.

Chow Institute embraces three research centers: the XMU-CAS Basic Science Center for Econometric Modelling and Economic Policy Studies (sponsored by the NSFC Basic Science Center Project), the MOE Key Laboratory of Econometrics (Xiamen University), and the XMU Center for Macroeconomic Research (an MOE Key Research Base in Social Sciences).

XMU-CAS Basic Science Center for Econometric Modelling and Economic Policy Studies is jointly managed by Chow Institute and the Center for Forecasting Science at Chinese Academy of Sciences. Approved in 2019, the Basic Science Center is the first national basic science center project not only in the Management Science Division of National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), but also in Fujian Province and Xiamen University. Combining research strengths of Xiamen University and Chinese Academy of Sciences in the fields of econometrics, statistics and data science, forecasting science, policy studies, quantitative finance, international economics, environmental economics and climate change economics, the Basic Science Center actively promotes in-depth interdisciplinary exploration, and strives to deliver cutting-edge research. It is positioned to be an academic highland for econometric modeling and economic forecasting with international influence.

MOE Key Laboratory of Econometrics (Xiamen University) is among one of the first key laboratories of the Ministry of Education (MOE) founded in 2009. As China's first key laboratory in Economics, the Key Lab strives to promote econometrics education, research and international academic exchanges in Xiamen University and China.

XMU Center for Macroeconomic Research was established in September 2001 with a specific research agenda focusing on policy relevance. Since February 2005, the center has become a key research base in humanities and social sciences of the Ministry of Education. It is also one of the most important components of the National Philosophy and Social Science Innovation Base, and has long been engaging in China's macroeconomic analysis and forecasting research.

Mission and Goal
Chow Institute is dedicated to becoming a leading economic institution that focuses on econometrics and quantitative policy analysis in China and Asia. 

As an international hub for academic exchange, the institute is committed to rigorous theoretical work, innovative research paradigms, and interdisciplinary synergies. It also serves as a highly influential institute in policy research, providing evidence-based policy insights into areas such as economic growth, development, and social governance. Additionally, it is a premier center for training a group of academic talents with a strong theoretical foundation, who can apply cutting-edge econometrics methods and possess a deep understanding of China's economic system.

The fellowship extends from September 1 to June 1. Fellows receive a stipend paid in nine equal installments. Ordinarily, home institutions provide a portion of their salaries in addition to benefits, although this is not a requirement. Independent scholars are eligible to apply.

Main considerations in the evaluation of applications are the following:
The significance of the proposed research and its relevance to the purposes of the University Center for Human Values (see http://uchv.princeton.edu/)
The quality of a candidate's previous research and the contribution the candidate is likely to make in the future through their scholarship
The likelihood that the research would benefit from being conducted in the University Center environment

How to Apply
Candidates must submit an online application at https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/39121. 

Required materials:
1. A CV 
2. One scholarly paper (no more than 12,000 words) written in the past three years

Maternal Health
Infant Health",Postdoctoral Fellow,"Dr. Tim Bruckner seeks a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Joe C. Wen School of Population and Public Health at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), to work on two projects. The main project involves understanding structural, economic, and policy-level causes of racial disparities in stillbirth and live birth outcomes in the US. The secondary project will assist with quantifying the extent to which postponement of childbearing in Denmark affects health, educational, labor market, and other societal costs—both for parents and their children. The fellowship is a one-year appointment with the possibility of one-to-two-year renewal. This appointment is contingent upon receipt of the Ph.D. prior to the start date.

The funded NIH project in the US aims to understand racial differences over time in stillbirth, preterm birth, and neonatal mortality in the US. We will use the universe of live births, infant deaths, and fetal deaths in the US (~70 million records) to rigorously examine race-specific trends in preterm birth and infant mortality rates. In addition, we will use a structural racism theoretical framework to examine the extent to which dynamic race-based spatial indicators of inequality affect patterns in fetal loss, selection in utero, and infant mortality among preterm births.

Separately, the secondary project is motivated by the fact that the age of first-time mothers in Denmark has increased by more than 20%, from 24.8 years in 1981 to 29.8 years in 2021. We aim to understand the extent to which postponement of childbearing affects birth outcomes, children’s health and educational outcomes, and parental labor force participation. We will characterize changes over time (i.e., 1980 to 2018) in parents’ delay of childbearing in Denmark and delineate which demographic groups in particular account for these trends. We will exploit the longitudinal nature of register data to use sibling-control and maternal fixed-effects methods to estimate biologically-based sequelae of older age at childbearing (>30 years) as well as social “selection” into postponed childbearing.

Work Expectation: Whereas the candidate is expected to have an in-person presence at UCI at least 2 days a week, remote work arrangements are negotiable.

Qualifications:
- PhD in epidemiology, economics, sociology, demography, or a related field
- Background in epidemiology, demography, health policy or biostatistics
- Background in maternal and infant health
- Fluency in at least two of the following: STATA, R, SAS

Duties:
- Conduct independent research using the US birth file and the California microdata birth cohort file, under the guidance of Professor Tim Bruckner, Department of Health, Society & Behavior. Submit articles for publication.
- Conduct research using the full force of the Danish Registers (1980 to 2018), under the guidance of Professor Tim Bruckner.
- Participate in project meetings and other events with the team from Johns Hopkins, Berkeley, Columbia, and Duke University, as well as colloquia in the School of Population and Public Health. You will also attend colloquia at the Center for Population, Inequality, and Policy, as relevant.
- Have the option to attend graduate coursework in the Program in Public Health and elsewhere.

The Postdoctoral Fellow will also have other opportunities for collaborative and independent research projects, as part of the Bruckner Lab (https://sites.uci.edu/brucknerlab/). They will be expected to engage with the Project Teams at UCI and internationally, the Wen School of Population and Public Health, and the Center for Population, Inequality, and Policy (UCI).

The school is open with regards to the specific area and approach. However, we are particularly interested in a scholar who uses population-based data and methods to examine how the social and/or biological hallmarks of aging, including innovative biomarkers of aging, intersect with public policy across the life course to affect health and longevity. Alternatively, we are also particularly interested in a public policy scholar who studies the regulation and/or economic impact of emerging therapies and biomedical advances designed to improve health span, including, for example, supplements/drugs, gene therapies, and neural implants. This includes the study of government and/or private regulation surrounding biomedical advances in aging, and/or how these emerging technologies will affect law, the economy, population demographics, inequality, healthcare delivery, and healthcare costs. Overall, our goal is to identify a scholar who primarily focuses on U.S. domestic public policy.

The successful candidate will advance the educational mission of the College of Letters & Science that values, prioritizes, and actualizes evidence-based and student-centered teaching and (undergraduate student) mentoring. They will contribute to an environment that fosters engagement and a sense of belonging for faculty, staff, students and members of the broader community.

The selected candidate will conduct productive research, be a committed teacher, and welcome being part of an interdisciplinary department dedicated to promoting good public policy. Teaching will involve core graduate and undergraduate courses in public affairs or international public affairs, as well as upper-level electives.

We anticipate that the selected candidate will participate in interdisciplinary and collaborative efforts with research centers and other departments, schools and colleges as is fitting for the position.

The successful candidate, as a member of the College of L&S, will proactively contribute to, support, and advance the college’s commitment to excellence among all aspects of their teaching, mentoring, research, and service.

As part of UW-Madison’s RISE-THRIVE initiative, the College of Letters & Science is making a bold, interdisciplinary investment in research and teaching that advances our understanding of health, disease, well-being, and resilience for individuals and their communities.   By exploring the social, economic, technological, historical, environmental, behavioral, and public policy factors that shape health outcomes, L&S RISE-THRIVE researchers advance innovative solutions to such urgent societal challenges as healthy aging, chronic disease, mental health, social marginalization, and rural and urban health–all of which enhances lives and communities in Wisconsin and beyond.

The La Follette School is a highly ranked school of public policy, and one of many highly ranked social science units at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The University is consistently ranked among the top universities in terms of success in federally funded research grants and is highly supportive of an interdisciplinary approach to scholarship. 

This faculty position is part of the Wisconsin Research, Innovation and Scholarly Excellence (RISE) Initiative.

By hiring up to seven faculty researchers as part of UW-Madison’s RISE-THRIVE initiative, the College seeks to further bolster its expertise and capacity to serve as a dynamic hub for interdisciplinary and collaborative health research—one that integrates quantitative, qualitative, and community-engaged forms of research and brings this mixed-methods approach to bear on the complexities of health, disease, well-being and resilience, and aging.  L&S researchers explore the social, economic, historical, environmental, and behavioral factors that shape health outcomes, while advancing knowledge in genomics, epigenetics, and demography as well as driving innovation in health policy and technology—all for the goal of fostering healthier lives and healthier communities.

The fellowship aims to create academic spaces and platforms in which a variety of perspectives are recognized as scholarly contributions, including those addressing historical inequities. The fellowship was established in 1985.

Gaius Charles Bolin was the first Black graduate of Williams in 1889. He was an active and influential member of his class who went on to a successful career as a lawyer in Poughkeepsie, New York. Bolin also was a founding member of the local branch of the NAACP and was the first African American president of the Dutchess County Bar Association. In 1969, eighty years after Gaius Bolin graduated, Joseph E. Harris, the first Black tenure-line faculty member, was hired at Williams.

These fellowships, which honor Gaius Bolin’s legacy, are two-year residencies at Williams. Two scholars or artists are appointed each year. Fellows devote the bulk of the first year to the completion of dissertation work while also teaching one course as a faculty member in one of the college’s academic departments or programs. The second year of residency, preferably with a terminal degree in hand, is spent on academic career development while again teaching just one course.

The Bolin Fellowships are awarded to applicants who show exceptional promise as scholars, who have an interest in and capacity for teaching students in a community that is broadly diverse with regard to, among other things, race, gender, citizenship, ethnicity, religion, and who are pursuing a career in higher education in the United States. Ph.D. candidates must have completed all doctoral work except the dissertation by the end of the current academic year.

The annual stipend for the position is $57,000. The College will also provide health and dental benefits, relocation and housing assistance, academic support including office space and a computer, and an annual allowance of $4,000 for research-related expenses.

During the period of residence at Williams, the Bolin Fellows will be affiliated with an appropriate department or program and will be expected to teach one one-semester course each year, normally in the fall semester of year one and the spring semester of year two.

Eligible candidates for the fellowship include all U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, and U.S. permanent residents (holders of a Permanent Resident Card); individuals granted deferred action status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program; Indigenous individuals exercising rights associated with the Jay Treaty of 1794; individuals granted Temporary Protected Status; asylees; and refugees. Eligible candidates may apply to more than one academic unit.

Units that will be participating in 2025-26 are: Asian American Studies; Biology; Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics (BiGP); Classics; Economics; Geosciences; Jewish Studies; Music; Neuroscience; Physics and Astronomy; Political Science; Romance Languages (Spanish); Science and Technology Studies (STS)  (PLEASE NOTE: participating units change from year to year.)
