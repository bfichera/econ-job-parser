The Digital Economic Security Lab is recruiting a postdoctoral researcher with a background in politics, law, economics, or related disciplines to work on *GEOCLOUD: The Geopolitics of Cloud Computing*, a European Research Council Advanced Grant project.

Outsourcing computation to cloud providers can be economically efficient while at the same time generating new systemic risks and dependencies that governments try to manage.

GEOCLOUD is concerned with mapping the changing geography of computational infrastructures and understanding how it is shaped by the interaction of technology companies’ business interests and states’ economic and security interests.

The project focuses on Europe and East/Southeast Asia, situated within the broader context of U.S.-China technological rivalry. It aims to contribute to international political economy, security studies, and related fields. The researcher will join a multi-disciplinary team led by Professor Vili Lehdonvirta, consisting of both computer and social scientists.

**Principal investigator and community**

The project’s principal investigator, professor Vili Lehdonvirta, is a Finnish-British sociologist and political economist with a background in computer science. He is the recipient of three European Research Council grants, has served on high-level expert groups at the European Commission, and has published two books on digital economies translated to Japanese, Chinese, and Italian. He holds a dual appointment as Professor of Technology Policy, Department of Computer Science, Aalto University, and Professor of Economic Sociology and Digital Social Research, Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford.

The postdoctoral researcher position is part of Professor Lehdonvirta’s Aalto-Oxford joint research group, titled the [Digital Economic Security Lab (DIESL)](https://diesl.eu/). The multidisciplinary lab comprises both social and computer scientists. The lab’s joint activities include weekly cross-site virtual seminars, annual in-person workshops in Oxford and Helsinki, and conference trips.

**Responsibilities**

The postdoctoral researcher will lead a work package in the GEOCLOUD project that focuses on comparative policy analysis. The aim of the work package is to understand how governments attempt to influence the geography of computation through various cloud-relevant policies, and what impact these policies may have.

This involves three related responsibilities:

**1.** **Documenting and categorizing government cloud policies**

The researcher will develop a dataset of government policies that may shape cloud infrastructure in selected jurisdictions, including Northern Europe, East/Southeast Asia, the U.S., and China. Drawing on existing databases (such as the Digital Trade Integration Database and Digital Policy Alert) and additional sources, the postdoc will systematise policy examples into a format suitable for comparative and quantitative analysis. Relevant policy instruments may include cross-border data flow regulations, procurement rules (e.g. ‘cloud-first’ mandates), tax incentives, infrastructure investments, or designations such as ‘trusted cloud’.

**2.** **Interview-based assessment of policy impacts**

The researcher will conduct interviews with key stakeholders in selected countries. These include policy makers and cloud industry professionals. The goal is to assess the perceived and observed effects of government policies on cloud adoption, infrastructure investments, and data centre location decisions.

**3.** **Contributing to quantitative analysis of policy impacts**

The GEOCLOUD project team will use the cloud policy dataset together with infrastructure and usage data developed in other work packages to model how policies influence cloud geography and computational centralization.

Methods may include multiple regression, panel data models, difference-in-differences, and multilevel modeling.

The postdoc will take part in the analysis to test hypotheses on how specific policies (e.g. subsidies, foundry investments, procurement rules) shape outcomes such as data centre presence or market share of local vs. hyperscale solutions. These analyses will contribute to estimating the economic and political trade-offs of digital sovereignty goals.

The role can be adjusted towards qualitative or quantitative research, depending on the profile of the successful candidate. Additional support for data collection and analysis is available, depending on the researcher’s methodological focus and needs.

In addition to leading their own work package, the postdoctoral researcher will contribute to the broader GEOCLOUD project by co-authoring publications, guiding junior team members, and engaging in public outreach. They will also play a role in shaping the project’s future outputs, such as an open-access “Cloud Observatory” data portal.

Overall, the postdoctoral position requires strong research and teamwork skills, and in return offers excellent career development opportunities, including travel funding, open access publication funding, co-authoring opportunities, graduate supervision opportunities, training courses, access to academic networks in Helsinki, Oxford, and beyond. In particular, Professor Lehdonvirta is keen to support team members in ultimately developing their own ERC Starting Grant applications.

(vii) to examine as required by the appropriate committee.

**The postholders will be expected to undertake further duties for Nuffield College including:**

(ii) to act as a mentor for graduate students, where appropriate, and to represent the College’s body of postdoctoral research fellows on one of the College’s committees, and to take on College officerships, where appropriate.

Candidates will have recently completed, or be close to completing, a PhD in a relevant subject. They will have publications in peer-reviewed journals commensurate with their career level. They will have the ability to present research findings effectively, to innovate and work effectively with colleagues and to play a part in developing the Department’s and the College’s research programme, as well as being able to teach high-achieving graduate students. Additionally, they will possess excellent oral and written communication and interpersonal skills and be willing to contribute more generally to the intellectual life of the Department and the College.

As part of your application, you will be required to provide details of three referees, who will then be able to upload letters of recommendation.

**ABOUT CJA**

The New York City Criminal Justice Agency (CJA) is a not-for-profit service and research organization that operates in partnership with the New York City Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice. CJA is the City’s main pretrial services agency, combining operations, pilot projects, and research under one roof. CJA utilizes procedural justice practices to provide pretrial services to over 100,000 arrested annually in New York City. Information collected about these arrestees and subsequent case processing is maintained in the agency’s internal and externally shared database systems, which are used to conduct descriptive and evaluation research on arrestee characteristics, case processing and court outcomes, and on issues and potential reforms to criminal justice policy in New York City. CJA’s programs operate in the criminal courts and detention facilities 24 hours a day seven days a week within the 5 boroughs of NYC, employing over 300 employees, citywide.

**PROGRAM SUMMARY**

DART – We lead research and analytics that turn CJA’s unparalleled justice system data into insights that drive policy and practice. Drawing on over 100,000 annual face-to-face interviews and comprehensive data feeds from police, courts, and corrections, we analyze complex trends, evaluate emerging policies, and apply causal techniques to assess the impact of policy and applied interventions. Through rigorous analysis, compelling visualizations, and impactful publications, we illuminate the workings of New York City’s justice system and advance new lines of inquiry to shape a fairer, more effective system.

**POSITION SUMMARY**

As a Senior Data Scientist, you will deliver advanced analytics that drive policy and practice. You’ll combine expertise in causal inference—including RCTs and quasi-experimental methods—with policy relevant data analysis, predictive modeling, and modern machine learning techniques.

Conduct power and sample size calculations to optimize the design of RCTs and quasi-experimental studies. Translate findings from causal analyses into actionable recommendations that inform policy and practice.
- Research Dissemination and Communication – Deliver policy briefs, presentations, and interactive dashboards that translate complex findings into actionable, decision-ready evidence.
- Partner with city agencies, nonprofits, and justice system stakeholders to scope projects and align research with operational needs. Support public and stakeholder engagement by presenting results at conferences, policy forums, and cross-agency working groups.

The position is allocated to the Research Training Group 'Coping with Uncertainty in Dynamic Economies' (CUDE), which is concerned with a new subfield in economic theory that merges two features central to current and future economies: uncertainty and dynamics.

Here, uncertainty is understood in the sense of Frank Knight, in that decision makers struggle to assign reliable estimates of probabilities to future events. This Knightian uncertainty is widely believed to capture our world's mega trends such as climate change, energy crisis, migration, pandemics, and technological development. Its analysis has been a central research topic in decision theory for the last two decades, and increasingly in microeconomic theory more generally, currently being explored at research centers around the world. As main innovation of our program, we seek to explore the implications of uncertainty in dynamic economies, which is vastly understudied at present but critical to answer the economic questions raised by the aforementioned mega trends.
